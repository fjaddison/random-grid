# Non-Uniform Grid

This is a script using p5js to create a non-uniform grid with randomly sized rectangles.

See the outputs [here](https://fjaddison.github.io/random-grid/).

[This blog post](https://gorillasun.de/blog/An-Algorithm-for-Irregular-Grids) by Ahmad Mousa was very helpful. I took his idea of using a 2D boolean grid and tried to fill recreate it in my own way.
